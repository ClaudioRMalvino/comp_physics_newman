# Computational Physics Projects in Python

Welcome to my repository showcasing my Python project in computational physics. These projects highlight my ability to solve complex physics problems using advanced programming techniques.
All exercises will be drawn from Mark Newman's textbook Computational Physics. 

Covered topics: 

1. **Chapter 2: Python Programming for Physicists**
2. **Chapter 3: Graphics and Visualizations**
3. **Chapter 4: Accuracy and Speed**
4. **Chapter 5: Integrals and Derivatives**
5. **Chapter 6: Solution of Linear and Nonlinear Equations**
6. **Chapter 7: Fourier Transforms**
7. **Chapter 8: Ordinary Differential Equations**
8. **Chapter 9: Partial Differential Equations**
9. **Chapter 10: Random Processes and Monte Carlo Methods**
